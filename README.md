# Game of life

Game of life (aka life) is a simulation of a very basic two dimensional universe portrayed like a grid of square cells. These cells have two possible states (dead or alive) that are determined by a very few elementary fixed set of rules.

The basic and fascinating idea of GoL is to show the amount of complexity generated by 4 simple rules! 

### Rules

- Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbours dies, as if by underpopulation.

- Any live cell with two or three live neighbours lives on to the next generation.

- Any live cell with more than three live neighbours dies, as if by overpopulation.

- Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbours becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction.

### Implementation

This GoL is implemented using HTML CSS and JavaScript. It is based on [this work](http://pmav.eu/)
